# Lab 02 — Branching and Pull Requests

Day 1 of the [CI/CD for Ignition Masterclass](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-masterclass).

> Compare branching strategies side by side, and learn to write a pull request a reviewer actually enjoys reading.

This is the second lab in the course. The subject of the exercises is a real (if
small) **Ignition project** — a Perspective HMI screen (the Oatmakers Site 04
oat-line overview, the client from Lab 01) and a couple of Python script libraries — running on a local gateway you
spin up yourself. You don't need prior Ignition experience: the gateway's
*administrative* complexity (config, modules, databases, deploys) is deliberately
**abstracted away**, and what you actually edit is approachable — a small Python
function, or a property on a view. The point of the lab is the **Git workflow**
around those project files: branching, pull requests, and review. The full Ignition
file-based deploy story arrives in [Lab 04](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-04-ignition-file-based-deploy).

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Lab 01](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-01-git-fundamentals)
- Pass [`cicd-preflight`](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-preflight)
- Docker (with the Compose V2 plugin) for the optional gateway — ~1.5 GB RAM is plenty for the single gateway

## Working model: fork and PR

This lab has you open real PRs, review your peers', and merge your own when
approved — so everyone needs merge rights on the repo they're PRing into. The clean
way to get that without handing a whole cohort write access to one repo: **work in
your own fork, and open PRs inside it.**

1. **Fork + clone** (sets `origin` to your fork, `upstream` to the lab repo):
   ```bash
   gh repo fork mustry-academy/cicd-lab-02-branching-and-prs --clone
   cd cicd-lab-02-branching-and-prs
   ```
2. Branch and push to **your** fork (`git push -u origin <branch>`).
3. Open PRs with **base = your fork's `main`**, compare = your branch.
4. **Share each PR link in the cohort chat** so peers can find and review it.
5. You own your fork, so you can merge your own PRs once they're approved.

## Quick start

Spin up your gateway (optional, but it makes the project tangible):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
scripts/setup.sh        # boots one Ignition gateway, waits for RUNNING, prints the URL + login
# open http://localhost:8088  → log in with the .env credentials
```

Before opening any PR, run the validator — the green/red signal this lab uses in
place of a test suite (gateway-free, runs in a second):

```bash
scripts/validate.sh     # every project file must be valid JSON / parse as Python
```

Stop the gateway when you're done:

```bash
scripts/teardown.sh             # stop (keeps the gateway's data volume)
scripts/teardown.sh --volumes   # stop and wipe gateway state for a fresh start
```

### Picking up your edits

A running gateway does **not** auto-detect changes to files under `projects/`. The
simplest way to load your edits is to reload the gateway — no API key needed:

```bash
docker compose restart      # reload the project from disk
```

If you'd rather hot-reload without a full restart, set up a one-time Ignition API
key (optional — instructions in `.env.example`) and trigger a project scan instead:

```bash
scripts/scan.sh                 # faster reload via the gateway's scan API
```

## Lab structure

The whole lab lives in one file, [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md): a single
**We-do / we do / you do** flow covering two linked topics —

- **Branching strategies** — Git Flow vs GitHub Flow vs trunk-based, captured in a one-page team agreement
- **Pull requests** — scope, review, and merge hygiene

The you-do ties them together: you write your team's branching rules, then open, review, and merge real PRs that follow them.

## The Compose stack

A single Ignition 8.3 gateway. Two things to understand about how it's wired:

- **The gateway's own config and runtime state live in a named volume** (`ignition-data`) that the gateway generates itself on first boot. It never lands in the repo — which is exactly why you never see or touch gateway config in this lab. (That's Lab 04's subject.)
- **Only `./projects` is bind-mounted** from the repo into the gateway. So the project files you edit on your laptop *are* the project files the gateway runs.

```yaml
services:
  ignition:
    image: inductiveautomation/ignition:8.3.6
    ports: ["8088:8088"]
    volumes:
      - ignition-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data        # gateway-owned, self-generated, not in git
      - ./projects:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/projects   # the one thing you edit

volumes:
  ignition-data:
```

> The gateway regenerates a `.resources/` blob store and other operational files inside `projects/` as it runs. Those are gateway-owned churn and are gitignored — if you ever see them in `git status`, your ignore rules are off.

> **No CI in this lab.** We deliberately ship no `.github/workflows/`. `scripts/validate.sh` is something *you* run; Lab 03 turns it into a required status check no one can merge past. Having pre-built CI here would muddy that narrative.
